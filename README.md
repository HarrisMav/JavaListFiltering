# JavaListFiltering

Created a Java solution based on interview exercise. Completion time around 15 minutes. Due to technical issues the repo
was set up late. 

Utilised the main method to print the result and a List Utilities class to write my logic in. Having had more time I would
have written Unit Tests though after the development was done I realised it is better to push without tests and do them later,
have been trying to sort out my GitHub access since.

# Prerequisites

1) Download Intellij IDEA
2) Setup the latest JDK through it after opening the project with it 
3) Run the project

Re-reading the spec it said that what is needed to do is have a least with at least 4 duplicates. Not exactly 4. On retrospect
what should have happened is randomise a number from a range of 4 to 10 and then use that as the number of duplicates we need. 
For that to happen as mentioned in the JavaDoc I would need to write an if statement in the method that needs to take into consideration
that the duplicates can be the same amount as the amount of numbers required.
